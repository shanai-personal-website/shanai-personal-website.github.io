                Hi, I'm Shanai, a graduate Computer Science student from London
                with a particular interest in artificial intelligence. I just
                graduated from the University of Durham, ranking 2nd in my
                cohort, and spent the summer of 2023 interning with the Alexa AI
                organization at Amazon. Currently, I run my own small company as
                I save up money to attend an AI/ML masters programme. Please
                scroll down for some examples of recent work, my most recent
                side project involved training a GPT-2 sized model from scratch
                and improving its reasoning capabilities by finetuning
                (o1-style) it with process supervision and RL!

                  <strong>Description: </strong>My final-year university project
                  was a self-proposed research project which involved designing
                  a novel transformer-based architecture that aimed to learn
                  semantically meaningful hierarchical representations from its
                  training data. I learned more from this project than anything
                  else at university.

                  Footprint was a journaling app that allowed users to upload
                  text, audio, and video entries — before Apple offered the same
                  within their own native app. I developed it as an independent
                  side project during my first year of university. It has now
                  been taken off the App Store since I, regrettably, do not have
                  time to keep it updated.
