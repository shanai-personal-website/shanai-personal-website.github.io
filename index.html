              Hi, i'm Shanai! I recently graduated with a BSc in Computer
              Science from Durham University, where I ranked second in my
              cohort. I have a strong passion for machine learning and
              artificial intelligence, and intend to enroll in a related
              master’s program. I am scheduled to begin an Applied Science
              (research) internship at Amazon in early 2025, am interviewing for
              additional research roles in the summer, and currently spend my
              time growing a "startup" that I founded.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
              My research interests include deep generative modeling for drug
              and materials discovery, and reinforcement learning on large
              pretrained models to enhance their capabilities and alignment.
              Indeed, my most recent side project involved training a 124M
              parameter autoregressive transformer from scratch and improving
              its reasoning capabilities using a separately trained process
              reward model.

                  semantically meaningful hierarchical representations from its
                  training data. I learned more from working with my supervisor
                  on this project than anything else at university.
